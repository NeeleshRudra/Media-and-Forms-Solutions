    <h2>Early Life of Physics Wallah founder - Alakh Pandey</h2>
    <p>Alakh Pandey was born & brought up in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh. Alakh was excellent in studies to support his family financially, so he started teaching students when he was in 8th standard. He later wanted to go to IIT but failed to crack the entrance exam for IIT. So he was admitted to an engineering college in Kanpur for mechanical engineering. But his family had to sell the house to pay the engineering fees. 

    In college, Alakh had developed a keen interest in acting by taking part in drama & he wanted to become an actor. He used to love acting, as communication is the key, so he combined his passion & profession as acting & teaching skills & which made him a unique teacher. </p>
