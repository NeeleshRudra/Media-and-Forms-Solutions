            <h1 id="about html">What is HTML</h1>

            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring the content of web pages. It forms the foundation of web development and is the backbone of every website on the internet. HTML uses a set of tags or elements to define the structure and meaning of the content within a web page.

           HTML is interpreted and rendered by web browsers, which convert the markup into a visual representation that users can interact with. It is often combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity to create dynamic and engaging web experiences.
                
          Overall, HTML provides the structure and semantics necessary for building web pages, enabling the display and organization of content on the World Wide Web.</p>

            <p>Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML elements that convey meaning and semantic structure to the content of a web page. By choosing appropriate semantic elements, web developers can provide additional context and enhance the accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and maintainability of their web pages. Semantic HTML helps both humans and machines understand the purpose and structure of the content.</p>

            <p> Here are some commonly used semantic HTML elements:
                <br>
                <br>
                1.  <strong>Header</strong>: Represents the introductory content or a container for a set of navigational links at the beginning of a document or section.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. <strong>Nav</strong>: Represents a section of a page that contains navigation links allowing users to navigate within the website or to different parts of the document.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. <strong>Main</strong>: Represents the main content of a document or the primary content within a body element.
                <br>
                <br>
                4. <strong>Article</strong>: Represents a self-contained composition, such as a blog post, news article, or forum post.
                <br>
                <br>
                5. <strong>Section</strong>: Represents a thematic grouping of content within a document, typically with a heading.
                <br>
                <br>
                6. <strong>Aside</strong>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as sidebars, pull quotes, or advertisements.
                <br>
                <br>
                7. <strong>Footer</strong>: Represents the footer of a document or a section, typically containing information about the author, copyright notice, links to related documents, or contact details.
                <br>
                <br>
                8. <strong>Figure</strong> and <strong>Figcaption</strong>: Used together to represent self-contained content, such as images, illustrations, diagrams, or code snippets, along with a caption.
                <br>
                <br>
                9. <strong>Time</strong>: Represents a specific date, time, or duration, providing semantic meaning and enabling machine-readable information.
                <br>
                <br>
                10. <strong>Blockquote</strong>: Represents a section that is quoted from another source, usually with a citation or attribution.
                <br>
                <br>
                Using these semantic elements appropriately helps assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to better understand the content and present it to users with disabilities. It also helps search engines to interpret and index the content accurately, potentially improving the SEO of the page. Additionally, using semantic HTML makes it easier for developers to maintain and update the codebase, as the structure and purpose of the content are clearly defined.
